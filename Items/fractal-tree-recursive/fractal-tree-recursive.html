                    <p>A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different
                    scales.
                    They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals
                    are images of dynamic systems
                    – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely
                    familiar, since nature is full of fractals.</p>
                    <p>
                    For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc.
                    Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and
                    over.</p>

                    <h3 class="display-4 mb-3">What is a Fractal Tree?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fractals are seen in the branches of trees from the way a tree grows limbs.
                        The main trunk of the tree is the origin point for the Fractal and each set of branches that grow off
                        of that main trunk subsequently have their own branches that continue to grow and have branches of their own.
                        Eventually the branches become small enough they become twigs, and these twigs will eventually grow into bigger branches
                        and have twigs of their own.
                        This cycle creates an “infinite” pattern of tree branches. Each branch of the tree resembles a smaller scale version of
                        the whole shape.
